# Football_Players_Wages_Prediction

A MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

In Football player wages prediction we have taken numerous factors which affects the PRICE of the wage of a football players the factors are as follows:-

1.Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical technique used to estimate the relationship between a variable and one or more variables. In the context of predicting players' salaries, regression lines can be used to model the relationship between a player's salary (the variable) and multiple unusual factors (the player's age, position, statistics, etc.). Linear regression is especially useful when we want to predict a continuous variable (such as a player's salary) based on a continuous process or categorical independent variable. It also helps us determine which independent variables are associated with different variables, allowing us to better understand the impact on player salaries. Predictive models in many fields, including sports. By using linear regression to predict players' salaries, we can understand the factors that affect players' salaries and make more informed decisions about player acquisitions and contracts.

2.Mean Square Error

Mean square error (MSE) is a measure to evaluate the performance of the prediction model. It measures the mean square difference between the predicted and actual values ​​of the data set. In the context of predicting athletes' salaries, MSE can help us determine how well the model performs in predicting players' salaries. If MSE is low, it means our model is working well in predicting players' salary. On the other hand, a high MSE means that our model is not accurate in predicting players' salaries. For example, if we have two models predicting players' salaries, we can calculate the MSE of each model and compare them to see which model performs better. This can help us choose a model that suits our purpose. It allows us to evaluate and improve the performance of the model, allowing us to make more predictions and make better decisions in football player salary prediction studies.
